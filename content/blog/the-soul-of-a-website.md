When [Shaumik](http://dada.theblogbowl.in) told me about this [contest](http://theblogbowl.in/contests/contest/the-elegant-world-wide-web/view/) on his new [blog directory site](http://theblogbowl.in), I had to pick my favorite site to write about.

Considering I spend most of my [wakeful state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefulness) online jumping from site to site, this was not an easy task. With a few new tabs on screen, I watched my fingers dance over the keyboard almost involuntarily, giving me a list of sites I visit often:

*   [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
*   [Quora](http://quora.com)
*   [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)
*   [GMail](http://mail.google.com)
*   [Github](http://github.com)

These are great sites, some give me information, some help me connect, some learn and some are just so [beautifully designed](http://dropbox.com). But there was a recent addition to the above _hall of fame_ which changed the way I saw websites altogether.

It's not the most pretty site but

I can talk about how **_[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/about)_** has information about everything [music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/), [sports](http://www.reddit.com/r/sports/), [futurology](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology), [programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/), [minimalism](http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism), [explainlikeimfive](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive), [calvinandhobbes](http://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes), just everything!

Or why it so fun, the sarcastic comments, hosts exciting [AskMeAnythings](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mj1yl/amaa_ask_madonna_almost_anything), has an overall great [community](http://nymag.com/news/features/reddit-2012-7/).

But that is not what makes it exceptional.

_It's greatness lies in it's soul._

![Reddit has a heart](/images/2014/10/reddit_alien.jpg)

In a world where a significant amount of people are on the internet, most sites just want to make money out of you. If you don't want to pay for a site, they'll copy your contacts, sell your information, sell you!

But reddit was different. Let me show you how:

*   The frickin' [CEO explains users](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1sndxe/weve_rewritten_our_user_agreement_come_check_it/cdzaf2a) the change in user agreement in as simple words as possible! I've never ever seen in all of my virtual life, the **CEO** of a company explain the legal document people agree to without it even looking at it.

*   Sub reddits like [/r/yishansucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/yishansucks) that make fun of the CEO exist on the site and he loves it. He [promotes](https://www.quora.com/Trolling/Was-Yishan-Wong-just-trolling-Reddit-when-he-posted-a-9GAG-repost-of-Reddit-material/answer/Yishan-Wong) it as well!

*   When sites like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/245058342280723) force people use their real names, reddit doesn't mind. Anonymous and throw away accounts are common, especially when people want to [respond candidly](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1unchy/redditors_who_have_undergone_sexual_reassignment/cejy0x1) but do not want to reveal their identities.

![The truth](/images/2014/10/Oscar_Wilde_V_for_Vendetta.jpg)

*   They [open sourced](http://blog.reddit.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html) their entire code in 2008! Now the world not just contributes to the site, they can contribute to the code running it as well.

*   Instead of selling their user's data, they chose to look for alternate methods of revenue generation, like reddit gold and reddit gifts.

**[Reddit Gold](http://www.reddit.com/gold/about)** is a premium membership program which offers simple benefits like highlighted comments and special offers from other companies. In addition to buying gold for yourself, you can _gift gold_ to authors of [comments](http://www.reddit.com/comments/gilded) you like. In fact, gilded comments got viral and _more people gift gold to strangers than buying for themselves making the world a happier place :)_

Buying this gold, people also support the site they love and spend time on.

![Daily Gold](/images/2014/10/goldvertisement_v2_sm__1_.png)

**[Reddit Gifts](http://redditgifts.com/about/)** is a massive online gifts exchange marketplace. They connect internet stranger friends dozens of times a year sending out gifts around the world.

They've been setting and breaking their own Guiness records of largest gift exchange programs since 2011. Even Bill Gates participated this year!

*   Lastly, reddit has had some great people:

[Alexis Ohanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Ohanian), one of the founders actively campained against internet censorshop laws in US. He helped organize protests against SOPA/PIPA. He also wrote a [book](http://withouttheirpermission.com/about-the-book) about his journey and how you can harness the power of the web for good.

[Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), [internet's own child](http://aaronswartzthedocumentary.com/) died fighting for an open world. He was an amazing programmer, contributed to the RSS spec, was a notable wikipedia contributer and wrote a python web framework web.py. He joined forces of his startup [infogami with reddit](http://blog.reddit.com/2006/02/infogami.html) becoming a part of the reddit team.

* * *

They have proved that a huge site can function without being evil. **_Their mission is to bring more happiness to the world_** and that is what makes them amazing.

Some more goodness:
