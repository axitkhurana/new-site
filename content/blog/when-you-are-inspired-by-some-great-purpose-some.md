<blockquote><p>When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all of your thoughts break their bonds: your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed<br/>
yourself to be.</p></blockquote>Robin Sharma, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari
