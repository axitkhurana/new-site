	<h1>PyCon &#39;15 sprints: first CPython patch <aside> </aside></h1>
	

<p>The best part of PyCon is not the conference itself. It&rsquo;s after PyCon.</p>

<p>Sprints are 4 days of access to the best python minds helping you build software that the world uses. Django, CPython, Mailman, Sage, pandas, buildbot <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/">and many more</a> participated last year.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want to miss sprints. In fact, if you have 3 days only I would suggest you choose sprints over the conference itself. Talks and tutorials are recorded, you can watch them whenever you&rsquo;d like.</p>

<h2 id="cpython">CPython</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had been thinking about contributing to CPython for a long time, occasionally fishing for easy issues in the bug tracker, following the core-mentorship list, downloading the source etc. I was so ready to fix something!</p>

<p>After the intros to sprint projects and I went to the CPython room, started looking at the list of bugs to fix.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a fix that wasn&rsquo;t just documentation or too small to feel like I missed the opportunity. After going through a couple I found this one: <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue7159">Urllib2 authentication memory</a> which looked significant but good work for 4 days in a new codebase.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>For each request requiring HTTP authentication, urllib2 submits the
request without authentication, receives the server&rsquo;s 401
error/challenge, then re-submits the request with authentication.</p>

<p>This is compliant behavior. The problem comes in that urllib2 repeats
this for every ensuing request to <em>the same namespace.</em></p>

<p>At times this is just an inefficiency&ndash;every request gets sent twice,
often with POST data (which can be sizeable).</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially with large POST bodies, this causes a connection
failure.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t non-compliant behavior, but RFC2617 (sections 2, 3.3)
suggests that once an HTTP client authenticates, it pre-emptively send
authentication with ensuing requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is every time urllib2 sends a request with basic auth, it will first make the request without credentials, get a 401 unauthorized, check the auth the endpoint expects and then send the same request with credentials.</p>

<p>This is expected behavior but inefficient if we know the endpoint needs the credentials. We&rsquo;re making 2x the number of requests!</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>Before I even thought about writing a fix, I was curious why this was RFC compliant behavior. Why not just send the credentials?</p>

<p>I had a feeling this was because of the stateless nature of HTTP, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt">RFC 2617</a> gave me a little more information:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;basic&rdquo; authentication scheme is based on the model that the
   client must authenticate itself with a user-ID and a password for
   each realm.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of an unauthorized request for a URI within the
   protection space, the origin server MAY respond with a challenge like
   the following:</p>

<pre><code> WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=&quot;WallyWorld&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>where &ldquo;WallyWorld&rdquo; is the string assigned by the server to identify
   the protection space of the Request-URI.</p>

<p>To receive authorization, the client sends the userid and password,
   separated by a single colon (&rdquo;:&ldquo;) character, within a base64
   encoded string in the credentials.</p>

<p>A client SHOULD assume that all paths at or deeper than the depth of
   the last symbolic element in the path field of the Request-URI also
   are within the protection space specified by the Basic realm value of
   the current challenge. <strong>A client MAY preemptively send the
   corresponding Authorization header with requests for resources in
   that space without receipt of <em>another</em> challenge from the server.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="things-to-fix">Things to fix</h3>

<ol>
<li>According to the RFC a client <strong>may</strong> preemptively send auth headers after the first challenge, so once we hit the URL without the credentials, get back a 401, we can send the credentials in subsequent requests.</li>
<li>Another <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue19494">issue</a> mentions some APIs like Github doesn&rsquo;t send 401 for unauthorized, they send 404s which means we should have the ability to directly send the credentials without getting the first 401.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>

<p>The API isn&rsquo;t the most friendly one (you should use <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">requests</a> instead), but this is how you make a request:</p>

<pre><code>  51 # set up authentication info
  52 authinfo = urllib.request.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()
  53 authinfo.add_password(realm='PDQ Application',
  54                       uri='https://mahler:8092/site-updates.py',
  55                       user='klem',
  56                       passwd='geheim$parole')
  57
  58 proxy_support = urllib.request.ProxyHandler({&quot;http&quot; : &quot;http://ahad-haam:3128&quot;})
  59
  60 # build a new opener that adds authentication and caching FTP handlers
  61 opener = urllib.request.build_opener(proxy_support, authinfo,
  62                                      urllib.request.CacheFTPHandler)
  63
  64 # install it
  65 urllib.request.install_opener(opener)
  66
  67 f = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.python.org/')
</code></pre>

<p>Two classes we care about here:</p>

<ol>
<li>HTTPBasicAuthHandler: specifies what do  for different status codes with methods</li>
<li>PasswordManager: manages username, password, realm for your requests</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="initial-approach">Initial approach</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/fb3061ba6fd2">existing patch</a> added a new <code>BasicAuthHandler</code> subclass that sends the credentials without even waiting for the first 401. That would work the Github case but not the first case.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-patch">Proposed patch</h3>

<p>We released instead of creating a subclassing <code>BasicAuthHandler</code> we could just add a new password manager that subclasses <code>HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm</code>. Since we want to support sending credentials even before we get a 401 response from the server (which has the realm value), we store the password in a default (<code>None</code>) realm.</p>

<h4 id="httppasswordmgrwithpriorauth">HTTPPasswordMgrWithPriorAuth</h4>

<p>Subclasses <code>HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm</code> and adds a <code>uri -&gt; is_authenticated</code> mapping. What that gives us is that if the user has already authenticated for a particular URL root, we don&rsquo;t need to get a 401 from the server for every request for that URL tree, we can just send the credentials.</p>

<h5 id="whaat">Whaat?</h5>

<ol>
<li>Request to axitkhurana.com/locked/ (say this endpoint requires basic auth)</li>
<li>We get a 401 back</li>
<li>We send credentials this time</li>
<li>Get a 200 SUCCESS back</li>
<li>We update the dictionary mapping <code>{'/locked/': True}</code></li>
<li>Every subsequent request to /locked/ or /locked/abc sends the credentials without waiting for 401, <em>making everything ~2x faster</em></li>
</ol>

<h5 id="what-about-the-github-case">What about the Github case?</h5>

<p>Sending credentials even before the first 401.</p>

<p>Use the method:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>update_authenticated(self, uri, is_authenticated=False)</code>: Updates the <code>is_authenticated</code> flag for the given <em>uri</em> or list of URIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set <code>is_authenticated</code> to <code>True</code> before making a request manually instead of waiting for the first successful auth. Voila!</p>

<h3 id="accepted">Accepted</h3>

<p>After some design discussions, tests, a couple more useful methods and <a href="https://twitter.com/rdavidmurray">R. David Murray</a> rewriting the docs to make them readable, I finally got my <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/1b9e81cb83bc">first contribution to CPython</a>!</p>
